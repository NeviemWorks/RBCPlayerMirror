# RBCPlayerSimple
## A simple Web Radio player for the RBC Radio Station

---

## Introduction:
This is a simple  and minimalistic  Web Player to Stream the live feed of RBC Radio. Feel free to use this repository
as a starting ground for your own project. You can update the stream link with your own and update the website's color
theme and icons to match your branding. If you see any issues with the code, please let me know on discord where
I have the handle ```_.m.k.```. Also have fun customizing this to your liking and adding additional features!

### Notes:
- This project uses the AzuraCast API to fetch the song info
- Also uses TypicalMedia AzuraCast servers to fetch the livestream
- Song requests are not fully implemented yet as I have not found a way to connect them with AzuraCast
- I am NOT AFFILIATED with RBC nor TypicalMedia. This project uses a publicly accessible API.
